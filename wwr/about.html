          <p>Rafting is an extreme sport that you should take as a form of entertainment. You can also practice it with friends, family and people from a young age.
             There are a lot of rivers in which this sport can be practiced amazingly. For this sport, everyone needs inflatable boats or blasas, which are propelled
             by oars and steered from the stern, carrying the crew and the raft through the turbulent waters of the rivers.</p>

        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>Rafitng originated in the 1950s in the United States and Europe. After the end of World War II, the inflatable boats of the operations carried out by maritime 'commando'
        units were used in the fast rivers for recreational purposes. Since then, as time passed, sport began to commercialize. It is said that the first company to offer its first 
        commercial use was in the French Alps (Central Europe). Later, rafting companies emerged in the United States.</p>
